\section{Conclusion}

In this project we successfully implemented two nature-inspired optimisation algorithms, namely the Firefly algorithm, and the Artificial Bee Colony algorithm. We evaluated the Firefly algorithm on the DTLZ1 problem, while the ABC algorithm was used to solve the Travelling Salesman Problem. Both algorithms were compared to a given reference (Evolutionary algorithm), and we were able to achieve similar performance on both problems. In the case of the Firefly algorithm on the DTLZ1 problem, our approach even outperformed the Evolutionary algorithm. The Artificial Bee Colony algorithm achieved comparable results on the much harder Travelling Salesman Problem.
