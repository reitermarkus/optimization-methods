This document provides some documentation and analysis of the project that is
part of the course \textit{nature inspired optimisation methods}. We
implemented the \textit{Firefly} algorithm \cite{firefly}, and the
\textit{Artificial Bee Colony} \cite{beecolony} algorithm. In the following we
will briefly describe those algorithms, and show some performance comparisons
to other optimisation methods.
