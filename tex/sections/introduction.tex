This document provides some documentation and analysis of the project that is
part of the course \textit{Optimization Methods}. We
implemented the \textit{Firefly} algorithm \cite{firefly} as well as the
\textit{Artificial Bee Colony} \cite{beecolony} algorithm. In the following we
will briefly describe both algorithms and show some performance comparisons
to other optimisation methods.
